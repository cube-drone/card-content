          Ask yourself this: have you ever seen an atom?

          No, of course you haven't.

      The **burden of proof** is on the scientists to prove that atoms are real.

      If you are **claiming** that atoms are real, then you need to **prove** it.

      More and more people are starting to realize that atoms are nothing more than a theory.

      According to **atom believers**, water is made up of atoms.

      They claim that a single molecule of water weighs 0.00000000000000000000

      00000016 kilograms.

      But is it possible they are just throwing big numbers at you to hide the _truth_?

      The truth is that atoms are just a theory.

      They are a **lie** that has been perpetuated by the scientific community for **centuries**.

      It's time to wake up and realize that atoms aren't real.

      Ancient philosophers from many cultures knew the **truth** about matter.

          The Greek philosopher Empenada believed that everything was made of four elements:
          earth, air, fire, and water.

          Chlorine is a **toxic** gas that is used to **kill** bacteria in swimming pools.

          And yet, according to **atom believers**, harmless table salt is made up of chlorine?

          It doesn't make any sense.

      Scientists claim that all matter exists in four states: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.

      According to Google, **plasma is over 10,000 degrees**.

      And yet, if you touch a plasma TV, it's **not hot at all**.

      How does **that** work?

      Ask a doctor if you have plasma in your blood.

      They'll say "yes".

      And yet we know that plasma is **over 10,000 degrees**.

      It **doesn't make any sense**.

          According to scientists, if you heat up a liquid, it turns into a gas.

          And yet, if you heat up a **liquid** egg, it turns into a **solid**.

          3. Heat it past 100 degrees.
          4. Watch as it **doesn't** turn into a gas.

      Here are some ways you can help:

      2. **Take** the red pill. No - not that one. That one's a **Benadryl**. The other one. The **truth** pill.
      3. No, not that one either. That is **estradiol**. How did you even get that?
      4. That is a **Skittle**. You are just eating random pills now.
